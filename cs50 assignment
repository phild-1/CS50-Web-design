}Instructions:</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Once they are mixed all together form a well in the center of the mixture.
Now it's time for the wet ingredients:in a glass measuring cup (not necessary but recommended for easy clean up, pouring, and measuring)combine the buttermilk and eggs. 
Mix those together and makes sure the egg has been completely broken up and no large chunks of yolk remain. Add the vanilla and slowly pour in the melted butter. 
Pour in the wet ingredients mixture in the well we formed earlier and mix. 

Take care to not over mix; just to the point that most of the flour is hydrated but there are
still lumps. Flour around the sides of the bowl, it will either get hydrated on its own during the batter's rest, or will get folded in by the next step. 
Which is whipping the egg whites to soft peaks and slowly folding them as to not deflate the air built up by the whipping. Once you have a lumpy, soft, mixture cover the
bowl and place it in the fridge to rest for thirty minutes. (This step is optional but recommended.)

In the last 5 minutes of the rest, place a non-stick pan on low-medium heat to allow it to get heated, so the pancakes can have nice and uniform
browning. Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan simply let it cook. When bubbles start to form around the rim of the pancakes and the rim begins to slighty solify
flip and let it cook for another 30 seconds to a minute. Repeat this process until your run out of batter. 

Lastly garnish with toppings of your choice and enjoy.
